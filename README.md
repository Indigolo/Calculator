# Calculator

Project:
Create a simple calculator with simple functions.

Diary:
Starting uni after tomorrow, anxious, but researching about it, especially the building, made me a bit excited/hopeful.
Probably won't have enough time for TOP. Want to start going to the gym, learn well, go out with (maybe new) friends and continue to play video games.
Feel that bittersweetness of finishing a good LN.

Too many things, too little time. (Probably... we'll see!)
